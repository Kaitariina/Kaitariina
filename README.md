### Hi there, I am glad you are here :coffee:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is **Katariina** and I'm a programmer.

&nbsp; \
I mainly use ` Unity and C# ` with my projects. 

In smaller scale projects, such as our Migraine App prototype you can find from my pinned projects, I've used ` Java and Android Studio `. Using these I'm also preparing to have my personal companion plant app project ready for the next growing season. :seedling:

In addition, this far during my studies and for fun, I've learned the basics or more of: C++, Javascript, Python & Ruby.
